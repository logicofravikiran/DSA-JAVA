# DSA-JAVA
This repository contains my implementation of core Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. It includes practice problems, class notes, coding exercises, and solutions from platforms like LeetCode. The goal of this repo is to improve problem-solving skills, write clean code, and build a strong foundation in Java-based DSA.
